In the startup process emacs will read from ``init.el`` which will do
a few things and then tell emacs to compile and run
``config.org``. Most of my configuration is there.


To learn about a function put the point over it and hit ``C-h f
<enter>``. To learn about a variable put the cursor over it and hit
``C-h v <enter>``. Code blocks can be folded by putting the point
over them and hitting ``<TAB>``.
